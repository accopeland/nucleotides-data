- name: jgi_isolate_2x150
  description: The reads were generated on an Illumina HiSeq-2000 at the Joint Genome Institute. The reads were generated from pooled DNA from organisms with high-quality reference sequences. The sequencing produced 2x150 reads at a target insert size of 510bp. After sequencing these were separated into individual species by mapping onto the references. Each replicate was generated by subsampling down to 2,000,000.
