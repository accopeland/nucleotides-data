    The reads were generated on an Illumina HiSeq-2000 at the Joint Genome Institute. The reads were generated from pooled DNA from organisms with high-quality reference sequences. The sequencing produced 2x150 reads at a target insert size of 510bp. After sequencing these were separated into individual species by mapping onto the references.
